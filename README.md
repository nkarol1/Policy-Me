## Overview And Origin

The fintech domain that I have chosen for this assignment is Insurance Tech. My assignment is on a Toronto-based Online Insurance startup called PolicyMe. PolicyMe is headquartered in Toronto. This company was incorporated in 2018 by 3 people, which hold the following positions in the company -

 Andrew Ostro (CEO), Jeff McKay (Chief Technology Officer), Laura McKay (COO).
 
  The idea is to provide all Canadians a simple platform to buy insurance policies, fill out a few details, and have the information 
  available in as less as 20 minutes, rather than having people go through agents and have lengthy application times, where it might 
  take 4 to 6 weeks for approval. In short, it offers people competitive pricing and fast approval times.
  
  Policyme has 6 investors with Innovate Financial Health being the first investor in 2020, where they raised $25,000 CAD in initial 
  funding and then over time the funding amount increased, and so did the number of investors. The latest funding was secured in 2022 
  for 18 million CAD, bringing total funding to $21.5 million CAD to date.

 ## Business Activities

  PolicyMe is offering life insurance to Canadians at a much lower price as compared to a traditional way of getting a policy. By 
  elimination of inefficient underwriting and distribution costs, this digital platform is able to offer its products at 10-20 percent 
  lower than traditional offerings.

  The company’s products are available to all Canadians (Except Newfoundland) aged 18 to 75 years. Right now, the company is offering 
  critical illness Insurance and Term life insurance. PolicyMe has sold over $5 billion CAD worth of insurance coverage since its 
  inception. Around 70% of the Canadian population is between 18-75 years of age, so this company targets a large number of people to 
  sell its products. It has special offers for couples with kids, where if a couple applies together then they get a 10% discount on 
  premiums and they get $10,000 in free child coverage for the whole term.

  PolicyMe markets itself as a pioneer in the online insurance field. Although it is hard to say that this company has any unfair 
  advantage over other companies. It offers a competitive rate as compared to other companies, less human interaction, and no 
  medical checkups prior to the insurance. It has made other traditional companies venture into online insurance as well at a much 
  faster pace than before.

  As a technology-driven completely online company, POlicyMe relies heavily on modern technology and machine learning. Some of 
  the tools used by PolicyMe are as follows- 

  * One of the major features used by PolicyMe is AI and Machine Learning - It uses an Algorithmic Underwriting Engine designed to 
   instantly assess customer risk and provide an immediate decision to them about policies that are suitable for them.

 * Cloud Computing – Another major reason for PolicyMe to keep its prices low is its use of Cloud Computing. As it doesn’t have any 
   physical offices except one small office in downtown Toronto. It uses cloud computing to store & access clients’ data.

 * Data analytics is another technology used by PolicyMe. It helps the company to gain insight into client data and helps to tailor 
   ts insurance policies as per the client’s requirement.

## Landscape

   PolicyMe comes under the Insurance domain. It is an emerging online insurance company providing Term Life & Critical Illness 
   Insurance.

   The insurance sector especially medical and health insurance has undergone vast developments and has seen tremendous changes in the 
   last 10 years. With the rise of technology, it has become easy to store and access customer data. With a rising number of insurance 
   applications for mobile phones, now a client can access his/her policy information from anywhere and at any time. Filing claims 
   has become easy and quick. The advisors are just one call away and are available 24/7in some cases. There has been a rise in 
   the number of insurance companies as well and the market has become more competitive, which has resulted in lower premiums as 
   compared before. With the availability of cloud computing, AI, and machine learning, companies are able to reduce overhead costs 
   which in turn has reduced the number of locations, which in turn has helped companies to bring down their prices to attract more 
   customers. After Covid 19, people have become more aware of their health and in current times, public pension replacement 
   rates are declining and healthcare expenditure has increased.

   There are some other companies in this domain that are offering their services online and are strong competitors to 
   PolicyMe. Some names in this field are - PolicyAdvisor, Emma, Dayforward, and Dundas Life.

## Results 

   PolicyMe has been in the market only since 2018 but its presence has had a big impact in this field. PolicyMe was started as an online 
   insurance company, and it grew at a fast pace during COVID-19 and after. To date, it has sold insurance policies worth $5 billion. 
   It has made other major players like Sunlife, Manulife, etc. act quickly in developing a much more prominent online world. It saw 
   the shortcoming of a long waiting time for approval and realized that there was a lot of unnecessary underwriting that wasn’t 
   required but was time-consuming and involved high costs. PolicyMe also provides insurance usually with no medical test, which is 
   also one of the reasons that its client base has increased. 

   Some of the core metrics for companies in the insurance domain are 1) Conversion Rate, 2) Retentions Rate, 3) Customer Satisfaction 
   4) Response Time 5) Website traffic and User Engagement.

   1) PolicyMe has quite a good record maintaining these metrics. As they are completely online and policies can be available in 
      20 minutes, they have a client conversion rate of more than 25%.

   2) Their policies are 10 – 20 % cheaper than Big 5 insurance service providers & payments remain the same throughout the policy 
      timeline and don’t increase year after year. So, their retention rate is also very good at around 85%.

   3) Their customer satisfaction has an average rating of 4.3/5*.
      
   4) They are available 24/7 via call or via online chat service, which places them ahead of their competitors.

   5) PolicyMe has an average website visit of 45.8K on a 3-month average with a visit duration of 5:45. The Average page per visit is 
      9.03 and has an average bounce rate of 57.55%.

   Based on these metrics, Policyme is performing quite well compared to others, especially the Big 5s. Although other companies have been 
   in the market for quite some time and Policyme is relatively new with just over 5 years since its inception, it has sold 
   insurance coverage worth $5 Billion. Policyme has witnessed a string growth rate with a 700% year-over-year growth, which has 
   been helped by the pandemic as well.

## Recommendations

   Although PolicyMe has emerged as one of the leading service providers in the Life and Critical Illness insurance sector,  
   there is still a lot to cover and there are many other areas in the insurance sector that the company should look into and expand 
   itself. It can provide the following products and services to broaden its client base - 

   1)	Right now PolicyMe offers only Term Life Insurance and Critical Illness Insurance. It should venture out to Car, home, auto 
      and travel insurance as well and there is a huge market for these insurances.
   2)	PolicyMe is currently limited to a few provinces as it doesn’t provide services in Newfoundland.
   3)	Although the company is completely online. But in some cases, human interaction is necessary for some individuals. It has an 
      online chat service and a Zoom call service with one of the insurance advisors.

   If the company implements these strategies, it can benefit from growing demand and a large number of people looking for better 
   options in the market. Some of the benefits can be as follows - 

   1)	It will increase the company’s digital footprint.
   2)	As Policy Me is already offering competitive rates for Life and Critical Illness Insurance, there is a huge market to explore 
      in other insurance fields as well.
   3)	Offering other insurance will increase its customer base and if the company can combine a bunch of insurance and offer it as a 
     whole package with good pricing then more people will be attracted to this company and they can start looking into other 
     services offered by this company which in turn will increase the revenue.

  As the company will grow, so will its use of new technologies. Some of the technology that the company is already using can be
  used more widely in the future are Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, AI, and Machine Learning for transforming claims and underwriting 
  policies, Automated Risk Analysis. 

  The use of these technologies can be an appropriate solution based on the following observations - 

  1) As the company will provide a vast number of services, its client base will increase multifold. As the company is 100% online, 
     it would need a place to store clients’ data, so it can use Cloud Computing for that.
  2) Using AI to underwrite policies and transform claims will help the company keep its policy pricing low as compared to 
     its competitors. The company will save costs by having less human intervention in this field.
  3) Data Analytic tools to analyze different data provided and be able to provide the best policy available to the client.
  4) This technology can quickly analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and even predict future events as well.
